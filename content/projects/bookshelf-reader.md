# [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LakshyaKhatri/Bookshelf-Reader)
This application uses the [Bookshelf Reader REST API](https://github.com/LakshyaKhatri/Bookshelf-Reader-API) and provides book information from images of book spines. Just capture the image from your bookshelf and Bookshelf Reader will give you all the information on the available books in the image.

# Installation
Just download and install this [APK file](https://github.com/LakshyaKhatri/Bookshelf-Reader/app-debug.apk)

# Usage
* Capture image of a bookshelf from your camera or upload one from gallary (Make sure the spines are clearly visible).
* Bookshelf Reader will automatically detect separate the available books in the image from their spines. 
* Choose the book for which you want to get the information.
* To buy the book click on the GET ON AMAZON button.

# Here's How it Works

# Contributing
The whole framework was made for fun only. I used the general image processing techniques for making things work. I request everyone viewing this post to kindly help me improve this project by implementing it using machine learning agorithms (I have looked at some NNs that might do the job).
