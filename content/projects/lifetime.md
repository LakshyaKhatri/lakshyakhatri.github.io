<h2><a href="https://github.com/LakshyaKhatri/Lifetime/" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a></h2>

A minimalist immutable timer application for android that can count for several hours. I have no idea why I made this. One thing that I found though is using it to keep track of the number of hours that I have left on this earth.
