* Assistant can actually talk to you.
* Ask your Assistant to perform basic mathematical operations.
* It can play songs for you.
* Don't you know what day is today? Ask your Assistant then.
* Not Satisfyied? You can add your own functionalities too.
* And, Assistant is not married yet!

  * Choose the option for whatever editing you need and press enter.
  * Perform the edting.

> *__Note:__*  
> 1. *Do not add any punctuation marks at the end of the orders. Assistant will automatically handle them.*
> 2. *You need to add punctuations marks in the responses for explaining proper expressions to the Assistant for speaking.*  

**Math Opearions:**  
All the steps are same but instead of `createCommandFile.exe` use `mathCommandFile.exe`  and in linux use `./mathCommandFile` instead of `./createCommandFile`.
